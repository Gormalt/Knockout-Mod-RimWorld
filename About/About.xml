    <name>Knockout Medicine</name>
<description>Adds a medicine called "Knockout" to the game, which can temporarily put your pawns into sleepy time. Comes with negative health effects if used too often. 
Meant to be a balanced way of knocking out a pawn if you don't have cryosleep or other methods available.
You will need to research it and then craft it at a drug lab with Neutroamine and Chemfuel.</description>
